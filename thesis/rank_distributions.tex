        \textbf{Distribution of Ranks for Balanced Accuracy Evaluation Metric.} The figure shows the
        distribution of ranks computed across all datasets in the experiments. Ranks were computed
        from Balanced Accuracy scores for each preprocessing method separately. The red mark
        denotes each method’s mean rank, and three yellow marks indicate the 25th, 50th and 75th
        percentile.
