# LaTex and Python Sources for the Thesis

I wrote my thesis in LaTex and I used Python to automatically generate various figures and tables
which can be found in the `figures` and `tables` directories. The figures were generated using
`generate_figures.py` and the tables were generated using `generate_latex_tables.py`.

## Compiling the Thesis

To compile the thesis, simply run `make` from this directory.
