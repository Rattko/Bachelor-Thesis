# LaTex Sources for the Poster

I wrote my poster for the defence of the thesis in LaTex.

## Compiling the Poster

Firstly, we need to download [baposter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anriseth/baposter/master/baposter.cls)
and [picins](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex209/contrib/picins/picins.sty) libraries and place
these two files in this directory. Now, to compile the poster, simply run `make` from this directory.
